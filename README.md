# Projects Completed as Part of the Computer Science Program at UBB Cluj-Napoca

This repository contains projects developed as part of the Computer Science program at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca. The projects showcase both my work in university labs and individual efforts undertaken to deepen my understanding of the subjects, as well as preparation for exams.

The repository highlights various aspects of computer science, from programming and application development to databases and algorithms. It also demonstrates my independent work outside of lab exercises, focusing on enhancing my knowledge and skills in more advanced topics.
